  * "What HTML would have been, had it been designed for building web-apps"

  * Created by [Misko Hevery](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=misko%20hevery%20angularjs&sm=3) in 2009
  * Open Source, supported by Google
  * Extremely well documented
  * Vibrant community of users
  * Gaining traction in industry



## Features:
  * REST Easy.

    * Directives
    * Data binding
    * Dependency injection
    * ViewModel
    * Controllers
    * Views
    * Filters
    * Factories


## Main Concepts
  * Model - application data
  * View - what the user sees
  * Controller - application behavior
  * scope - 'glue' between a controller and a view (ViewModel)
  * Data binding - synchronize the model and user interface
  * Directives - They teach HTML new tricks!
    * Anytime you see **ng-** thats an Angular Directive ;-)
  * Dependency Injection
    * Giving a function an object.
    * Rather than creating an object inside a function, you pass it to the function.
  * Module - containers
  * Service - helps you organize and share code across your app.
